## What is Census?

The United Nations defines a population census as the total process of collecting, compiling, and publishing demographic, economic, and social data pertaining to a specific time to all persons in a country or delimited part of a country


# Objective

Your task is to build machine learning models to predict the income level (target variable) of the related collaborators in the evaluation set, being 0 a collaborator who has an income less than 50,000 USD annually, and 1 a collaborator who has an income equal to or greater than 50,000 USD annually.
